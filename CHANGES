	- DOS/Windows version
	- new WAV sound loader (to replace the old Amiga 8SVX files)
	- new PCX graphics loader (to avoid GIF license problems)
	- network multiplayer games with upto four players
	- no separate network server needed; each client can
	  fork a network server at startup if there's no server

	  network server (on a separate machine, for example)
	- local multiplayer games with upto four players

	  for the old XPM method)
	- supports private colormap with extremely less flashing
	  on 8-bit (256 colors) displays
	- soft-scrolling with 50 frames per second (which raises
	  the system requirements and makes it completely
	  unplayable on my "old reference" 486/33 (where 0.9b runs
	  smoothly) and running at 90% speed on my K6-200.
	- completely new file format for personal setup data
	  in ASCII format which is human readable and easily
	  customizable even with a texteditor; stored in the
	  user's home directory and no longer somewhere in the
	  game's installation directory
	- high score lists changed: now one file per level and
	  no longer one file per level series; now using readable
	  ASCII format
	- useful command line options to specify the X11 display,
	  the game's base (installation) directory, an alternate
	  level directory, standalone server execution and verbose
	  execution

	  and the fire buttons are mapped to the shift keys)

	  from the games "Boulderdash", "Emerald Mine" and
	  "Sokoban". New elements to build "Dynablaster" style

	  original C64 version, when aboeba cannot grow anymore
