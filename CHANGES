Release Version 1.2.0 [5 DEC 1998]
--------------------------------------------------------
	- DOS/Windows version
	- new WAV sound loader
	- new PCX graphics loader
	- network multiplayer games with upto four players
	- no separate network server needed; each client can
	  fork a network server at startup if there's no server
	  running at this moment
	- possibility to invoke the game to act as a standalone
	  network server (on a separate machine, for example)
	- local multiplayer games with upto four players
	- support for upto four joysticks
	- completely free customizable keyboard and joystick
	  for all four players individually
	- new joystick calibration screen which can be left
	  (with Escape key) if no joystick is connected... ;-)
	- new (working) GIF graphics loader (but still support
	  for the old XPM method)
	- supports private colormap with extremely less flashing
	  on 8-bit (256 colors) displays
	- soft-scrolling with 50 frames per second (which raises
	  the system requirements and makes it completely
	  unplayable on my "old reference" 486/33 (where 0.9b runs
	  smoothly) and running at 90% speed on my K6-200.
	- completely new file format for personal setup data
	  in ASCII format which is human readable and easily
	  customizable even with a texteditor; stored in the
	  user's home directory and no longer somewhere in the
	  game's installation directory
	- high score lists changed: now one file per level and
	  no longer one file per level series; now using readable
	  ASCII format
	- useful command line options to specify the X11 display,
	  the game's base (installation) directory, an alternate
	  level directory, standalone server execution and verbose
	  execution

Release Version 1.1 [???] [NOT RELEASED]
----------------------------------
	- new (but broken) GIF graphics loader to be independent
	  from the XPM library and replace all graphics by GIFs.

Release Version 1.0 [9 APR 1997] [NOT RELEASED]
---------------------------------------------
	- the game now contains many really playable levels,
	  not only a few levels for testing
	- the game is now even better playable by keyboard
	  (now you have the same gameplay functionality
	  compared to playing with a joystick. Especially
	  there are diagonal directions with keyboard playing
	  and the fire buttons are mapped to the shift keys)
	- a lot of new elements for better emulation of levels
	  from the games "Boulderdash", "Emerald Mine" and
	  "Sokoban". New elements to build "Dynablaster" style
	  levels.
	- enhanced functionality of the level tape recorder
	  to make it possible to go on with a game at any tape
	  position

Prerelease Version 0.9b2 [21 NOV 1995] [NOT RELEASED]

Prerelease Version 0.9b [4 NOV 1995]
----------------------------------
	- the game is now completely Freeware
	- the game is now better playable by keyboard
	  (in the last version, the player was making more than
          one step for one keystroke in some cases -- thanks to
	  Warwick Allison for the hint with "XSync()"!)
	- new amoeba type with configurable content (like in the
	  original C64 version, when aboeba cannot grow anymore
	  and explodes to diamonds or some other elements)
	- compile error with ONE_PER_NAME in high score function
	  removed (thanks to Dmitry Kohmanyuk)
	- little code cleanup (to get some new bugs ;)
	- FreeBSD sound and joystick support (thanks to Jean-Marc
	  Zucconi)
