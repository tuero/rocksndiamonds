	* graphics, sounds and music now fully configurable
	* bug fixed that prevented walking through tubes when gravity on

2002-04-02	src/events.c, src/editor.c
	* Make Escape key less aggressive when playing or when editing level.
	  This can be configured as an option in the setup menu. (Default is
	  "less aggressive" which means "ask user if something can be lost"
	  when pressing the Escape key.)

2002-04-02	src/screen.c
	* Added "graphics setup" screen.

2002-04-01	src/screen.c
	* Changed "choose level" setup screen stuff to be more generic (to
	  make it easier to add more "choose from generic tree" setup screens).

2002-04-01	src/config.c, src/timestamp.h
	* Added source files "src/config.[ch]" and "src/timestamp.h" (which
	  automatically gets created by "src/Makefile" and contains an actual
	  compile-time timestamp to identify development versions of the game).

2002-03-31	src/tape.c, src/events.c
	* Added quick game/tape save/load functions to tape stuff which can be
	  invoked by a keyboard shortcut. Default: "F1" saves game/tape, "F2"
	  loads previously recorded tape and directly goes into recording mode
	  from the end of the tape (therefore appending to the tape).

2002-03-31	src/tape.c
	* Added "index mark" function to tape recorder. When playing or
	  recording, "eject" button changes to "index" button. Setting index
	  mark is not yet implemented, but pressing index button when playing
	  allows very quick advancing to end of tape (when normal playing),
	  very fast forward mode (when playing with normal fast forward) or
	  very fast reaching of "pause before end of tape" (when playing with
	  "pause before end" playing mode).

2002-03-30	src/cartoons.c
	* Moved some stuff from cartoons.c to the new "src/libgame/toons.c".

2002-03-29	src/screen.c
	* Changed setup screen stuff to be more generic (to make it easier
	  to add more setup screens).

2002-03-23	src/main.c, src/main.h
	* Various changes due to the introduction of the new libgame files
	  "setup.c" and "joystick.c".

2002-03-23	src/files.c
	* Generic parts of "src/files.c" (mainly setup and level directory
	  stuff) moved to new libgame file "src/libgame/setup.c".

2002-03-23	src/joystick.c
	* File "src/joystick.c" moved to libgame source tree, with
	  correspondig changes.

2002-03-22	src/screens.c
	* "HandleChooseLevel()": Another bug in level series navigation fixed.
	  (Wrong level series information displayed when entering main group.)

2002-03-22	src/editor.c
	* Slight change to support new gadget event "GD_EVENT_INFO_LEAVING".

2002-03-22	src/editor.c
	* Changed behaviour of "Escape" key in level editor to be more
	  intuitive: When in "Element Properties" or "Level Info" mode,
	  return to "Drawing Mode" instead of leaving the level editor.

2002-03-21	src/game.c, src/editor.c, src/files.c
	* 2.0.1 introduced the corrected "Emerald Mine" style behaviour of
	  gems (emeralds, diamonds, ...) slipping down from normal wall,
	  steel wall and growing wall (as in E.M.C. style levels). Although
	  the behaviour of contributed and private levels wasn't changed (due
	  to the use of "level.game_version"; see previous entry), editing
	  those levels will (of course) change the behaviour accordingly.

	  This change seems a bit too hard after thinking about it, because
	  the EM style behaviour is not the "expected" behaviour (gems would
	  normally only slip down from "rounded" walls). Therefore this was
	  now changed to an element property for gem style elements, with the
	  default setting "off" (which means: no special EM style behaviour).
	  To fix older converted levels, this flag is set to "on" for pre-2.0
	  levels that are neither contributed nor private levels.

2002-03-20	src/files.h
	* Corrected settings for "level.game_version" depending of level type.
	  (Contributed and private levels always get played with game engine
	  version they were created with, while converted levels always get
	  played with the most recent version of the game engine, to let new
	  corrections of the emulation behaviour take effect.)

2002-03-20	src/main.h
	* Added "#include <time.h>". This seems to be needed by "tape.c" for
	  compiling the SDL version on some systems.
	  Thanks to the several people who pointed this out.

2002-03-19
	* Version number set to 2.0.2.

2002-03-19
	* Version 2.0.1 released.

2002-03-18	src/screens.c
	* "HandleChooseLevel()": Small bug in level series navigation fixed.

2002-03-18	src/files.c [src/libgame/misc.c]
	* Moved some common functions from src/files.c to src/libgame/misc.c.

2002-03-18	src/files.c [src/libgame/misc.c]
	* Changed permissions for new directories and saved files (especially
	  score files) according to suggestions of Debian users and mantainers.
	  Thanks to Drew Parsons <dparsons@emerall.com> for the patch.

2002-03-17	src/files.c
	* Changed "{Load|Save}{Level|Tape}()" to IFF style file format:
	  Replaced "cookie" header string ("ROCKSNDIAMONDS_...\n") with
	  real IFF style header "RND1....XXXX" (where "XXXX" is "CAVE"
	  for levels and "TAPE" for tapes). Old "cookie" style format is
	  still supported for reading. New level and tape files are written
	  in new format.

	* New IFF chunk "VERS" contains version numbers for file and game
	  (where "game version" is the version of the program that wrote the
	  file, and "file version" is a version number to distinguish files
	  with different format, for example after adding new features).

2002-03-15	src/screen.c
	* "DrawHallOfFame()": "FadeSounds()" when entering the hall of fame.
	  (Before, you heard a mixture of the in-game music and the
	  hall-of-fame music.)

2002-03-14	src/events.c
	* Function "DumpTape()" (files.c) now available by pressing 't' from
	  main menu (when in DEBUG mode).

2002-03-14	src/game.c
	* "GameWon()": When game was won playing a tape, now there is no delay
	  raising the score and no corresponding sound is played.

2002-03-14	src/files.c
	* Changed "LoadTape()" for real chunk support and also adjusted
	  "SaveTape()" accordingly.

2002-03-14	src/game.c, src/tape.c, src/files.c
	* Important changes to tape format: The old tape format stored all
	  actions with a real effect with a corresponding delay between the
	  stored actions. This had some major disadvantages (for example,
	  push delays had to be ignored, pressing a button for some seconds
	  mutated to several single button presses because of the non-action
	  delays between two action frames etc.). The new tape format just
	  stupidly records all device actions and replays them later. I really
	  don't know why I haven't solved it that way before?! Old-style tapes
	  (with tape file version less than 2.0) get converted to the new
	  format on-the-fly when loading and can therefore still be played;
	  only some minor parts of the old-style tape handling code was needed.
	  (A perfect conversion is not possible, because there is information
	  missing about the device actions between two action frames.)

2002-03-14	src/files.c
	* New function "DumpTape()" to dump the contents of the current tape
	  in a human readable format.

2002-03-14	src/game.c
	* Small tape bug fixed: When automatically advancing to next level
	  after a game was won, the tape from the previous level still was
	  loaded as a tape for the new level.

2002-03-14	src/tape.c
	* Small graphical bug fixed: When pressing ""Record" or "Play" on
	  tape, cartoons did not get completely removed because
	  StopAnimation() was not called.

2002-03-13	src/files.c
	* Changed "LoadLevel()" and "SaveLevel()" to add new chunk "CNT2".
	  Fixed bug of "CONT" and "BODY" (chunk size was set to 8-bit element
	  size even when using 16-bit elements). Added new chunk "CNT2" for
	  16-bit amoeba content (previously written in 8-bit field in "HEAD"
	  chunk even when content was 16-bit element). "CNT2" should now be
	  able to store content for arbitrary elements (up to eight blocks of
	  3 x 3 element arrays). All "CNT2" elements will always be stored as
	  16-bit elements. "CONT" (with 8/16-bit elements) now obsolete.

2002-03-13	src/files.c
	* Changed "LoadLevel()" for real chunk support.

2002-03-12	src/game.c
	* Fixed problem (introduced after 2.0.0 release) with penguins
	  not getting killed by enemies

2002-02-24	src/game.c, src/main.h
	* Added "player->is_moving"; now "player->last_move_dir" does
	  not contain any information if the player is just moving at
	  the moment or not.
	  Before, "player->last_move_dir" was misused for this purpose
	  for  the robot stuff (robots don't kill players when they are
	  moving). But setting "player->last_move_dir" to MV_NO_MOVING
	  broke tapes when walking through pipes!
	  ("IS_MOVING()" uses "MovPos[][]", but this fails when it is 0
	  in a continuous movement. This fact is ignored for friends and
	  enemies, though.)
